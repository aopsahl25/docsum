The following is an example summary of a news article from a Mexican newspaper writing about how the US government is handling immigration:

$ python3 docsum.py docs/news-mx.txt

Here is a summary of the article at a first grade reading level:

The government of the United States has lost track of over 32,000 young people who came to the country alone. They don't know where these kids are or how they are doing. Some of these kids might be in danger. They might be hurt or treated badly. That's because the government agency in charge of helping these kids hasn't been doing a good job.

The experts say that the problem is that the agency isn't keeping track of the kids' information and isn't telling them when they need to go to court. This means that some of the kids might not know when they need to go to court or where they need to go.

The government is worried that these kids might be in danger and might be treated badly. They want to make sure that these kids are safe and that they have a good life in the United States.
